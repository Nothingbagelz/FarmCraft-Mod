# FarmCraft Modpack
### A mod for all your farming and cooking needs.
***
### Information
Using FarmCraft, you can plant new, exotic crops, cook exciting new foods, train pets, ride beasts, and enjoy yourself.
FarmCraft has the Essential mod downloaded, which is a mod that allows the user to play
locally with their friends.
In addition, a wide range of building materials and quality of life features have been introduced, 
such as Windows, Optifine, Waystones, optional shaders, and more, providing plenty of new features to explore.

Disclaimer: I do not own the rights to any of these mods, except for UnderMusic, 
and given that this modpack has over 71 mods, using a low-end device is not recommended. 
All the mods only run on Forge 1.19.2, that I know of._
